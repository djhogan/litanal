# Overview

A web application for sentiment analysis of classic literature. Currently, a small set of works is available for analysis.

The web application uses ExpressJS on the backend to listen and respond to HTTP requests. When the client selects a book, a GET request is sent to analyze the selected book and respond with the results as JSON. The client-side parses the results and displays them using D3. It may take up to a minute for the results to appear, depending on the length of the book.

The project is setup for deployment to heroku. To deploy it manually, install the node dependencies in package.json using npm and the python dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Build with "npm build" and start the server with "npm start" or "node server.js".
