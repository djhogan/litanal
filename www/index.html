		<h1>Sentiment Analysis of Classic Literature</h1>
		<p>
		Sentiment analysis measures the polarity of a piece of text. In this context, a positive polarity indicates "good" feelings (e.g. laughter, love) and a negative polarity indicates "bad" feelings (e.g. anger, sadness). Select one of the books below to see the smoothed sentiment scores displayed on a per-sentence basis. The sentence number is represented on the X axis and the sentiment score is represented on the Y axis. Click on an area of the graph to see the sentence at the corresponding position of the text.
		</p>
		<p>
		The sentiment score for a piece of text was calculated as the sum of the word scores. The word scores were taken from the AFINN lexicon (Nielsen 2011). A score of 0 was assigned to words absent from the lexicon. The score shown represents a moving mean taken over a window of 100 sentences in width.
